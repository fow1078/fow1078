## About Me

I'm young backend developer, with unstable curiosity and will to do coding. In short, I'm your friendly neighborhood code wizard who turns coffee into code🤔!

## What I Do

- **Kotlin Backend Development**: I speak fluent Kotlin, which is basically what would happen if Java and Swift had a child who preferred backend parties.
- **JavaScript Expertise**: I can bend JavaScript to my will and make it dance (or at least make it work). From vanilla JS to ES6, I’ve got you covered.
- **React (Barely)**: I dabble in React just enough to be dangerous. It's like knowing how to juggle three balls but with the constant fear of adding a fourth.

## Fun Facts

- I once debugged a production issue at 3 AM and found out the problem was that the code was haunted. True story.
- My code commits are like fine wine; they get better with age (or at least, that's what I tell myself).

## My Toolbox 🛠️

- **Kotlin**: The love of my coding life.
- **JavaScript**: My old reliable. We go way back.
- **React**: We have a complicated relationship.
- **Git**: Because version control is the only control I have in my life.
- **Coffee**: The fuel that powers my coding sessions.

Thanks for stopping by! Remember, coding is like humor. If you have to explain it, it’s bad. Happy coding! 😄
